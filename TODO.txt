# TODO IDEAS

# notes on live testing:
# gate needs to be shortened in general - it's too long
# some tempos simply aren't feasible (or necessary)
# note off may not need to occur for percussion - or gate maybe - ensure timing is greater than zero?
# app crashes when order used at a very high tempo
# make knobs more sensitive and gate shorter

# have init send lighting

# lfo's

# drunk mode in terms of value
# randomizer probability implemented with current arp value implementation
# randomizer / drunk mode in terms of tempo / probability
# NOTE aka swing

# ARP sync (button)
# NOTE could technically do this via offset, but likely not valuable at this point
# PHRASE sync (button)
# NOTE could technically do this via offset, but likely not valuable at this point

# parts we can map that have not been mapped yet

Best based on channel - 1-8, 10-12 (layer A)
----------------------------------
ARP/PHRASE on (button)
ARP/PHRASE tempo (knob)
ARP/PHRASE toggle (button)

LFO on (button)
LFO tempo (knob)
LFO type (button)
LFO sync (button)

Scenes and Tracks for live sets (modstep) (less feasible)

OMNI mode (layer B)
---------
Map based on what is used a lot
Can change knob controls by pressing - cycles through

# parts that could be remapped
- keyboard filter 'ON' (Track <)
- modstep filter 'ON' (Track >)
- sample mode 'TOGGLE' (Scene - up, down)
- play, stop (|>)

- channel 9 to channel 16

Other notes:
------------
ARP can be used as a drum roll for any instrument by changing tempo accordingly
ARP can be used with different values for channel 10 / 11 - see what combinations of percussion work
Try using ARP and PHRASE at the same time for a channel
Try using ARP or PHRASE with the FM (and the FM's ARP)
Might be interesting to have ARP and PHRASE sync options to try ARP and PHRASE where it doesn't match Ableton link
if you pass a variable into a recursive function by reference is will almost always change mid function
Midifire can remain open in front of modstep, but modstep will be doing most of the sequencing
Fugue Machine can be used to reverse, invert, bounce phrase

Micron and MicroBrute will be incorporated eventually

Completed:
----------

# make knobs infinite - so +1 instead of 0-127
# NOTE this will be unnecessary since we're implementing something similar by storing values
# make knobs control tempo - 1-10 1x Ableton link tempo, 11 1.1, 12 = 1.2, ... , 20 - 29 2x Ableton link tempo
# DONE

# arp add rest?
# DONE
# randomizer in terms of value
# DONE
