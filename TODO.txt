# TODO IDEAS

# make knobs infinite - so +1 instead of 0-127
# make knobs control tempo - 1-10 1x Ableton link tempo, 11 1.1, 12 = 1.2, ... , 20 - 29 2x Ableton link tempo
# lfo's

# arp add rest?
# randomizer / drunk mode in terms of value
# randomizer / drunk mode in terms of tempo / probability
# NOTE: this is likely more feasible for ARP, but phrase may work too by filtering clock through a streambyter instance (randomly / precisely add delays)
# NOTE: aka swing
# mapping everything

# parts we can map that have not been mapped yet

Best based on channel - 1-8, 10-12 (layer A)
----------------------------------
ARP on (button)
ARP tempo (knob)
ARP type (button)
# ARP sync (button)
PHRASE on (button)
PHRASE tempo (knob)
PHRASE type (button)
# PHRASE sync (button)
LFO on (button)
LFO tempo (knob)
LFO type (button)
LFO sync (button)

Scenes and Tracks for live sets (modstep) (less feasible)

OMNI mode (layer B)
---------
Map based on what is used a lot
Can change knob controls by pressing - cycles through

# parts that could be remapped
- keyboard filter 'ON' (Track <)
- modstep filter 'ON' (Track >)
- sample mode 'TOGGLE' (Scene - up, down)
- play, stop (|>)

Other notes:
------------
ARP can be used as a drum roll for any instrument by changing tempo accordingly
ARP can be used with different values for channel 10 / 11 - see what combinations of percussion work
Try using ARP and PHRASE at the same time for a channel
Try using ARP or PHRASE with the FM (and the FM's ARP)
Might be interesting to have ARP and PHRASE sync options to try ARP and PHRASE where it doesn't match Ableton link
if you pass a variable into a recursive function by reference is will almost always change mid function
Midifire can remain open in front of modstep, but modstep will be doing most of the sequencing
Fugue Machine can be used to reverse, invert, bounce phrase

Micron and MicroBrute will be incorporated eventually
