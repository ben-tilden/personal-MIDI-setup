# TODO IDEAS

# ensure xtouch receives currentChannel # pending implementation completion
# ensure channel information reset on init (will need to be done on individual files) # pending implementation completion

# TODO lfo params
# knob 1 press alternates lfo control
# knob 2 press restarts current lfo
# knob 1 rate; knob 2 depth

#global pushknob
#ensure lighting still functions properly xtouch to xtouch
#global reset X on hold

# notes on live testing:
# app crashes when order / phrase used at a very high tempo
# can put red tape to indicate

# knob to change channel instead of launchkey button

# lfo's

# when reviewing variables - review to see if it would be possible to create arrays just via offset and iterate through rather than have x if statements

# drunk mode in terms of value
# randomizer probability implemented with current arp value implementation
# randomizer / drunk mode in terms of tempo / probability
# NOTE aka swing

# ARP sync (button)
# NOTE could technically do this via offset, but likely not valuable at this point
# PHRASE sync (button)
# NOTE could technically do this via offset, but likely not valuable at this point

# parts we can map that have not been mapped yet

Best based on channel - 1-8, 10-12 (layer A)
----------------------------------
LFO on (button)
LFO tempo (knob)
LFO type (button)
LFO sync (button)

Scenes and Tracks for live sets (modstep) (less feasible)

OMNI mode (layer B)
---------
Map based on what is used a lot
Can change knob controls by pressing - cycles through

# parts that could be remapped
- keyboard filter 'ON' (Track <)
- modstep filter 'ON' (Track >)
- sample mode 'TOGGLE' (Scene - up, down)
- play, stop (|>)

- channel 9 to channel 16

Other notes:
------------
ARP can be used as a drum roll for any instrument by changing tempo accordingly
ARP can be used with different values for channel 10 / 11 - see what combinations of percussion work
Try using ARP and PHRASE at the same time for a channel
Try using ARP or PHRASE with the FM (and the FM's ARP)
Might be interesting to have ARP and PHRASE sync options to try ARP and PHRASE where it doesn't match Ableton link
if you pass a variable into a recursive function by reference is will almost always change mid function
Midifire can remain open in front of modstep, but modstep will be doing most of the sequencing
Fugue Machine can be used to reverse, invert, bounce phrase

Micron and MicroBrute will be incorporated eventually
