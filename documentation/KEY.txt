# key
# this file acts as reference for values in the global array and internal sysex formatting

# message routing key for signal messages (M1 = FF)
# if multiple, routes positioned left to right lowest value to highest
# 11 - launchkey
# FF - xtouch
# CC - channel
# 0F - xtouch filter
# 01 - lfo auv3 (mozaic)

# sysex key for value updates

# see doc

# output from files:

# xtouch
# sysex and CC to launchkey
# sysex to channel
# sysex to lfo auv3
# CC and note messages to xtouch device

# launchkey
# sysex to xtouch
# sysex to channel
# sysex to launchkey
# CC and note messages to iConnectMIDI

# channel
# note messages to iConnectMIDI

# drumParams:
# select $14 $15 $16
# level $17 $18 $19
# attack $20 $21 $22
# release $23 $24 $25
# pitch $26 $27 $28
# modAmount $29 $30 $31
# modRate $46 $47 $48

# when adding new passable value:
# 1. add key entry
# 2. add sysex reception
# 3. add ALIAS
# 4. add init set
# 5. add testing

# rules for push control
# 1. when a knob is set without turning, L should automatically be set to whatever is sent to the knob, otherwise it should be set to the current knob value
# NOTE tempo is an exception here because when the lighting is sent from xtouch, it does not loop back to the code until the knob is turned from the hardware - there is no opportunity to change the L value otherwise, so it must (unfortunately) manually be changed when the lighting is sent
# 2. if a knob is turning, L should only be set if knobPush is false
# 3. lighting should only be sent at knob release if the knob which is being turned does not already have code in xtouch that sends lighting for it (i.e. tempo) (the lighting change will be blocked otherwise)

Other notes:
------------
ARP can be used as a drum roll for any instrument by changing tempo accordingly
ARP can be used with different values for channel 10 / 11 - see what combinations of percussion work
Try using ARP and PHRASE at the same time for a channel
Try using ARP or PHRASE with the FM (and the FM's ARP)
Might be interesting to have ARP and PHRASE sync options to try ARP and PHRASE where it doesn't match Ableton link
if you pass a variable into a recursive function by reference is will almost always change mid function
Midifire can remain open in front of modstep, but modstep will be doing most of the sequencing
Fugue Machine can be used to reverse, invert, bounce phrase
Could map modstep to other buttons
